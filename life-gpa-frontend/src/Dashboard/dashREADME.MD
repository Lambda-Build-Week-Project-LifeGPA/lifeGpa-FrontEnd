### TAKE A LOOK AT THE DESIGN FILE `dashboard_design.js`
- see what components will be needed for the different parts of the app.
all components will be renedered to dashboard.js

### MVP for entire app
- Users create an account, log in, and tell the app a list of habits they want to track. 
- There are both prompts to add habits to your list, and spots to write your own. 
- The app evaluates the daily habits and rather than calculating streaks on a calendar, it calculates a percentage of times a certain habit has been done int he past 30, 60, or 90 days. 
- Then, it averages out all the habits' averages into one overall average. 
- All you do is tell the app which habits you performed each day.


STRETCH
- visualize the data over time on some sort of graph that shows improvement or a decline for the habits the user is choosing

### Nav Bar

1. website title name on left side
2. `welcome, 'username' ` on the right side( to be linked to the login )
3. maybe the `date:mm/dd/yyyy` in the middle or underneath the `welcome, 'username' `

### Habit card

- follow the design file for now.
- simple card with habit name and 2 button components with a yes and a no
( Decide with team if whole button should be clickable and or if bad habits should be included to show negative effect. )

### overall GPA 

- per mvp `'Then, it averages out all the habits' averages into one overall average.'`
(figure out with team where this will go)
